/// controller, the agents dashboard, and the automation coordinator. These were
/// previously raw `NSNotification.Name("PaneAgentStateChanged")` string literals
/// scattered across the poster and every observer — no compile-time safety, easy
/// to typo, hard to trace. Posting and observing through these constants makes
/// the set discoverable in one place and typo-proof; the event stream
/// (`sidekick-ctl events --follow`) leans on the same signals.
///
/// Raw values are unchanged from the old literals so anything that still posts a
/// string by hand keeps interoperating during the migration.
// These names are immutable Sendable constants observed and posted from both
// main-actor and background contexts (the IPC event stream, file watchers), so
// the extension opts out of the module's default main-actor isolation.
