/// Previously each `TerminalViewController` installed its own
/// `NSEvent.addLocalMonitorForEvents`, so every scroll / drag / mouse-up in the
/// app ran O(panes) closures — one per pane — even though only the pane under
/// the cursor ever acts on the event (P6). This installs exactly one monitor;
/// panes register on load and unregister on deinit, and each event is dispatched
/// to the pane whose terminal it lands on.
///
/// Handlers self-filter (window match, visibility, bounds) and return `nil` to
/// consume the event or the event to pass it through, so dispatch just walks the
/// registered panes and stops at the first one that consumes — behaviourally
/// identical to the old chain of monitors, minus the per-pane OS registrations.
