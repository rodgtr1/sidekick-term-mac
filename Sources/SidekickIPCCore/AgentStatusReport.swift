/// How an agent's hook reports a status change to Sidekick.
///
/// The original transport was an OSC 666 escape written to `/dev/tty`, which the
/// pane's terminal picks out of the output stream. That works from anything with
/// a controlling terminal — the shell integration, a pane's own shell, an agent
/// that runs its hooks as ordinary children.
///
/// It does not work from Claude Code, whose hook processes are spawned detached
/// from the controlling terminal: opening `/dev/tty` there fails with ENXIO
/// ("device not configured"), so every report was written nowhere and the pane
/// sat at `idle` for the entire run. Those processes *can* still reach Sidekick's
/// control socket (the telemetry hook already does), and they inherit
/// `SIDEKICK_PANE_ID` from the pane's environment, so the report is addressed to
/// the pane directly instead of riding its output stream.
///
/// Both transports land in the same place — the pane's `AgentStateDetector`,
/// marked hook-authoritative — so a report is delivered exactly once, by whichever
/// route is open.
